Already Behind: Asymmetric Money for Men Trapped in the Rat Race
================================================================

_A field manual from a trailer‑park kid who lost his daughter, drowned in credit cards and distraction, and decided to actually learn how money and the system work._

INTRO – Bathroom Floor Economics
--------------------------------

I did not learn about money from books or business school.

I learned about money from a trailer park, a bus‑driver grandmother, a stack of maxed‑out credit cards, a line of miserable jobs, and a bathroom floor after work where I sat night after night trying to figure out how I was going to get my family out of this.

I grew up in a trailer park in Harford County, Maryland. No mom tucking me in. No dad coming home from work. It was me and my grandmother. She drove a school bus and lived paycheck to paycheck. She knew how to keep the lights on and food in the house, and she taught me how to survive. How to read people. How to stay out of trouble.

What she did not have was any kind of financial education. Nobody in my life ever sat me down and explained saving, debt, investing, business, any of it. Money was just something that came in and went out. You worked, you paid bills, you hoped nothing bad happened.

That was my “money education.”

So at sixteen, I did what everyone around me did.

I got a job.

From there it was a straight line through the kind of work most people never put on Instagram. Selling popcorn and cleaning theaters. Grinding metal cylinders in a plant that made fire extinguishers. Running a machine that processed airport security swabs. Rotating moldy fruit in a grocery store. Cutting heavy aluminum blocks in a warehouse hot enough to cook you. Driving a mail truck in the heat. Standing behind a post office counter.

Different uniforms. Different buildings. Same trade.

Give us your body, your time, your focus, and we will give you just enough money that you can’t quite get ahead and can’t quite walk away.

For a long time I thought that was just life. I thought the goal was to be “responsible,” keep showing up, maybe move up a little, hope nothing big went wrong.

Then life hit me with something “responsible” could not touch.

My ten‑month‑old daughter was diagnosed with brain cancer.

If you think the system cares about you, you have never watched someone you love die while the bills keep coming and the job still expects you to show up. There is no pause button. No “take all the time you need.” The rent, the credit cards, the car, the utilities - none of them care. The Matrix still expects you to clock in on time.

My daughter died on February 14, 2024.

I watched my wife break under that weight and still drag herself to work. I drove back and forth to a job that barely covered bills. I sat in a trailer with no money, no financial education, and no map. On top of that, I had years of “free money” from credit cards quietly mutating into a monster in the background. I had wasted thousands of hours in video games and scrolling because deep down I did not know how to do anything else and nobody had taught me.

That is when the bathroom became my war room.

Every night after work I would sit on the floor in there, back against the wall, staring at nothing. No child. No savings. No plan. Just this burning question:

How does this system actually work, and how do I stop being food for it?

I did not disappear and come back as a millionaire. I did what I could with what I had.

I went to thrift stores and scanned books and shipped them to Amazon. I learned how online arbitrage worked. I read books and e‑books about money, finance, and systems. I started using AI to tear apart business models, careers, “passive income” claims, to see what was real and what was a sales pitch.

Some of it worked a little. I moved a few hundred thousand dollars’ worth of books through Amazon with thin profit margins. I learned spreadsheets, sourcing, inventory, fees. I learned how much work it takes to build something even a little better than a paycheck. I also learned how easy it is to burn years telling yourself “I’m working on it” when you are really just rearranging the same trap.

Then 2025 showed up and dropped thyroid cancer on me.

At some point you either break completely or you make a decision.

Here was mine:

I am done being a slave inside someone else’s dream.  
I am done pretending credit cards are safety.  
I am done numbing out and telling myself I will get serious “later.”  
Later already arrived.

When I say “Matrix,” I am not talking about a movie. I mean waking up every day in the rat race, going to work, making just enough to pay bills, and getting wiped back to zero every time life hits you with something big. I mean being a slave to a system that uses your time and energy as cheap fuel while the people who own it compound their freedom. I mean watching your life get milked away, shift by shift, building a thing you do not own and will never touch.

You know exactly what I am talking about.

This book is for men who are already behind. The ones who grew up with no real financial education, who got told “get a safe job and be responsible” and followed that script. The ones who took the credit cards because everyone said it was smart to “build credit.” The ones who numbed out with games, weed, scrolling, or whatever their poison was, and then woke up one day in a bathroom or a car or a warehouse and realized they had no savings, a pile of debt, and no idea how to get free.

I am not going to promise you millions. I am not going to tell you to quit your job tomorrow. I am not going to sell you “20 side hustles that will make you rich this weekend.”

You have heard enough of that garbage.

What I can give you is a clear picture of the game you are actually in when you are poor, in debt, and working a job. I can show you the traps that quietly own you - credit cards, distractions, fake safety nets - and how to start dismantling them. I can give you a way to use the little time, energy, and money you do have to start building leverage instead of just treading water. And I can lay out a one to three year path from “completely stuck and owned” to “moving, building, and not at the mercy of every hit life throws.”

I am writing this mid‑climb.

I still work. I still feel the cage. I still have days where I fight myself. But I understand the prison now. I see how the bars are built. I see how my own choices, my own distractions, and my own ignorance helped weld those bars in place.

If you are reading this, you probably feel that too.

This is not a victory lap. It is a field report from inside the fire and a playbook for how to walk out of it without lying to yourself.

If you are tired of being food for the system and you are willing to cut the bullshit, face the hole you have dug, and start playing a different game, keep reading.

If you want hype and shortcuts, close this now.

CHAPTER 1 – Trailer Park Education
----------------------------------

I grew up in a place where you learn to survive, not to build.

The trailer park was small. Thin walls, close neighbors, the same cars parked in the same spots for years. People argued about noise, dogs, and kids. Nobody argued about investments or business ideas because that world did not exist where I was.

Money came in. Money went out. Then you waited for the next check.

My grandmother did the best she could. She got up early, drove a school bus, came home tired. She made sure I ate. She tried to keep me out of trouble. On the things she knew, she was strong. But she had no map for anything beyond “work until you cannot.”

There was no talk of leverage, ownership, or systems. There was no “this is how wealthy people think.” There was “pay this bill or we get shut off.” That was the edge of the map.

So I absorbed the only rule I saw: when you are old enough, you get a job.

### First job: the theater

At sixteen I started working at a movie theater. Popcorn, soda, cleaning empty rooms after the credits. Minimum wage and the chance to watch movies for free if I stayed late.

I remember the first few paychecks. It felt like real money at the time. A few hundred dollars in my account made me feel grown when you have never had anything. I did not think about savings or growth. I thought, “I can finally buy what I want without asking.”

No one told me, “This is the most powerful money you will ever make because of time, and you are about to burn it.”

I worked, bought small things, wasted the rest, and went back for more. That pattern becomes normal if nobody interrupts it.

### Ten dollars an hour and heavy metal

Around eighteen I moved to a factory that built fire extinguishers for serious equipment. They told us some of it ended up on helicopters and other machines you do not want catching fire.

Pay: ten dollars an hour.

The drive was half an hour each way. The work was loud and physical. Grinding metal cylinders. Assembling parts. Standing on concrete all day. When I got home my clothes smelled like the plant.

Part of me was proud. It felt like “real work.” I was doing something that mattered, at least in theory. But when the math hit me, it never made sense. Ten dollars for one hour of grinding and lifting metal that ends up on machines worth millions.

I did not know what to do with that thought, so I buried it.

### The machine I did not own

My next move was a company that made security equipment for airports. If you have ever had your hands or bag swabbed at a checkpoint, something like what we built helped decide whether you walked through or got stopped.

At first I was just another body on the line. After a year or so my boss trusted me with a big machine that processed those swabs in bulk. Multiple compartments, a lot of moving parts. If it jammed, I had to figure it out. If it went down, production stopped.

On the surface that looked like progress. I was running something expensive and complex. People asked me for help.

But the paycheck did not care. I was still hourly. The machine might be worth more than my next few years of pay, but at the end of the week I was in the same spot as the guy who did the bare minimum.

That is when another thought showed up: being good at the wrong game just makes you a more useful piece.

Again, I pushed it down and kept going. I did not know another way to live.

### Nine dollars and bad fruit

After a layoff and some half‑hearted college classes, I ended up working produce at a grocery store.

Nine dollars an hour.

I spent my days rotating fruit, throwing out things that had gone soft or moldy, hauling boxes in and out of coolers. A lot of bending and lifting and wiping up messes.

There is nothing wrong with that work. But I would stand there with a cart of fruit and look at the prices on the signs and know that a few bags of groceries cost more than I was making in that hour.

I knew the store had rent, utilities, and all the rest. I knew the owner made real money. I knew if I doubled my effort it would not double my pay.

That feeling builds a quiet pressure in your chest. It is not rage yet. It is more like a slow awareness that the track you are on ends in the same place no matter how hard you pump your legs.

### Heat, dust, and the warehouse

The job that really branded this into me was at an aerospace plant that made aluminum honeycomb panels for aircraft.

We loaded heavy blocks of aluminum onto a sliding table and I used a bandsaw to cut them to size. The measurements had to be right within a tiny margin. We used tape measures and calipers over and over. You could not slack off or zone out. One mistake meant wasted material or worse.

The warehouse was hot. In the summer it felt like walking into the inside of a grill. No air conditioning. Just heat and humidity sitting on you all day. Aluminum dust stuck to your arms. You wore a mask and long sleeves. You drove forklifts carrying thousand‑pound blocks. You used an overhead crane knowing that if anything slipped at the wrong time, it could take off a limb before you even understood what happened.

Pay: twenty dollars an hour.

The most I had ever made.

There were mornings when I parked, stepped out of the car, and the air already felt heavy. By the time I reached the machine, sweat was running down my back. My arms would be grey from dust by lunch.

I remember one day standing at that bandsaw, watching the teeth chew through metal, feeling the vibration in my hands, and thinking, “If I die here, they will have a new guy on this machine in a week.”

The company owned the building, the contracts, the machines, and the relationships. I owned my sore body, my pay stub, and not much else.

That is when the word “slave” stopped feeling dramatic and started feeling accurate.

### Different job, same cage

I eventually quit the warehouse. Told myself I was chasing freedom.

I delivered food for a while. I leaned harder on credit cards. I played games. I told myself I would figure it out later.

Later never shows up on its own.

Then I got hired to drive a mail truck.

People imagine a calm walk down a street, sliding letters into boxes. The reality for me was long days in a hot truck, strict time windows, and pressure to push faster. You are part of a machine that measures everything in minutes and packages.

When I moved inside as a clerk it was easier on my body. No more warehouse heat. No more crane. But the trade was the same. Hours for money. Just enough to live, never enough to truly move.

### What the trailer park really taught me

Looking back, the thing that makes me the angriest is not any single job. It is that nobody around me ever showed me a different game.

Nobody said, “If you spend your twenties numbing out on games and using credit cards as a safety net, you are building a trap for your future self.”

Nobody said, “If you only ever trade time for money, every big hit in life will knock you back to zero.”

Nobody said, “There are systems behind all of this, and if you do not understand them, you are one of the pieces, not one of the players.”

I was working. I was sweating. I was doing what I had been told was right. But all that effort was poured into a path that could never give me what I secretly wanted: real freedom, real options, the ability to be there when it mattered without money deciding everything.

The trailer park taught me to survive. It did not teach me how to get out.

The next chapter is about what happens when life forces you to see the cost of that missing education all at once, and you finally decide that staying blind is no longer an option.

CHAPTER 2 – Credit Cards and the Distraction Web
-------------------------------------------------

Nobody handed me a bag of cash and said, “Here, ruin your future with this.”

They handed me credit.

When I turned eighteen, the same system that taught me nothing about money had no problem putting credit card offers in my face. The message was always the same.

“Build your credit.”  
“Have a safety net.”  
“Use it wisely.”

On paper that sounds responsible. You are young, you open an account, you make a few charges, you pay them off. Your credit score goes up. Banks and blogs tell you that you are doing it right.

What nobody explains is how thin the line is between “safety net” and “poison.”

### More cards, more “safety”

I started with one card, like most people. It felt like a grown up move. I could cover an emergency if I needed to. I could buy things even when my checking account was low.

Because I started young and made payments at first, my credit looked good. That unlocked more offers. Higher limits. More cards.

In my head, every new card and every increase in limit meant more safety. If the car broke down, I was covered. If I needed something important, I would not be stuck.

The truth was that every new line was just another tunnel I could dig under my own feet.

Here is how it works when you are already behind:

* You do not earn much.  
* You do not have savings.  
* You do not have a plan.  
* You do have feelings you do not want to sit with.

Credit becomes the easiest way to avoid all of that.

You swipe for small things at first. Gas. Groceries. A game. A night out. You tell yourself you will pay it off next month. Sometimes you do. Sometimes you do not. The balance inches up. The minimum payment feels manageable. Twenty here, thirty there, fifty there.

You keep working your job. You keep telling yourself you will “get serious” later. Later never has a date. It is just a foggy place in your head where somehow you are suddenly disciplined and calm and everything gets sorted out.

Years pass like that.

By the time you really look at the numbers, the card is no longer a tool. It is an animal that lives in the corner of your life and eats every month.

So you do what I did.

You get another card.

### Minimums and numbness

At my worst I was juggling multiple cards. I had good starting credit, so limits were not tiny. Every time life hit me with something I could not handle with my paycheck, I had an easy answer.

“Put it on the card.”

Car problem. Card.  
Unexpected bill. Card.  
Something I wanted but did not want to wait for. Card.

I was not running spreadsheets. I was not calculating interest. I was glancing at the minimum payment and asking myself, “Can I swing that this month?” If the answer was yes, I stopped thinking.

The balances crept up. The minimums ate more of each paycheck. I told myself it was fine because “at least I am building credit.” That is how deep the lie goes. You can be drowning and still be proud of your credit score.

While all of this was happening, I was also doing the other thing that keeps men stuck.

I was distracting myself to death.

### Years lost to the screen

For years, video games were my main escape. Not just an hour here and there. Whole chunks of my life disappeared into them.

I would work a shift, come home tired, tell myself I deserved a break, and sink into a game. Hours would go by. Whole evenings. Whole weekends when I had them.

It is not just the time. It is the way it rewires what you expect from effort.

In games, you see progress fast. Numbers go up. Levels unlock. Rewards drop. You hit a button and something happens. You die, you respawn. You try again.

Real life is the opposite. You can put in effort for weeks and see nothing. You can stay disciplined for a month and feel like you are still stuck in the same place. That gap makes reality feel broken compared to the screen. So you keep choosing the screen.

Credit cards and games fit together perfectly when you do not want to face your situation.

The games numb the feeling.  
The cards numb the consequences.

You tell yourself stories.

“I will get serious in my twenties.”  
“I will fix this when I make more.”  
“Once this rough patch is over, I will get it together.”

Then one day you wake up and you are not a teenager anymore.

You are twenty‑nine, or thirty‑five, or forty, and all the swipes and all the nights on the couch have turned into something huge and heavy that sits in the middle of your life.

### When reality cashed the bill

For me, that day came in pieces.

It did not hit me when I got another late fee or another statement. I could still numb that. It hit when something truly awful happened that money could not fix and I realized how unprepared I was for all of it.

When my daughter got sick, there was no “I will get serious later.” There was only now.

The drives to the hospital. The smells. The looks on doctors’ faces. The machines around her crib. The way time felt like it was slipping through my fingers.

And then, outside of that, there was the life I had built.

No savings.  
Cards with balances I did not want to look at.  
Job I could not just walk away from.  
Years of wasted time I could not get back.

I felt guilt for every hour I had given to distraction instead of building something. I felt guilt for every swipe on a card that could have been saved instead. I felt guilt that I could not be at the hospital every second because I had to clock in to pay bills that existed mostly because I had never taken money seriously.

That guilt burns.

It also does something useful if you let it.

It shows you the cost of the lies you have been living on. All at once.

### The web revealed

Sitting on that bathroom floor after work, after the hospital, after the funeral, I started to see the whole web instead of just the threads.

The job was part of it. The cards were part of it. The games were part of it. The lack of education was part of it. The culture that tells you “you have time” when you do not was part of it.

None of those things alone ruined my life. Together they built a cage that looked like “normal adulthood.”

That is the ugly part.

The Matrix does not need you to be stupid. It just needs you to stay numb and slightly behind. Numb enough that you do not question the trade. Behind enough that you cannot stop making it.

Once you see it clearly, you cannot unsee it.

The question then becomes:

What do you do with that anger and that guilt?  
Do you use it, or do you crawl back into the web and pretend you never saw it?

The next chapter is about what happened when I chose to use it.

CHAPTER 3 – The Bathroom War Room
---------------------------------

Grief does not care about your schedule.

Neither does rent.

After my daughter died, there was no clean timeline where life paused, I mourned, and then I went back to normal. There was no normal. There was only this broken mix of hospital memories, a job that did not stop, and a house full of reminders that she was gone.

I still had to show up to work. I still had to move mail and talk to customers and pretend I was not hollowed out. I still had to look at bills with her name never leaving my head.

When I got home, I did not have the luxury of collapsing forever.

If I let the grief turn into full collapse, we would end up on the street.

So my days split into two worlds.

In one world, I was the same guy the system wanted. I clocked in, did what I was told, kept things moving, and went home.

In the other world, I sat on the bathroom floor and tried to figure out how to make sure this did not end with “Cody spent his whole life in jobs he hated and never escaped.”

### The conversations in my head

Those nights were not pretty or organized. It was not some clean “now I will design my future” scene. It was a mess of thoughts that kept hitting the same questions.

How did I get here?  
How did I make it to my late twenties with no savings and a pile of debt?  
How was I stupid enough to waste whole years in games?  
How can money decide whether I get to be with my kid while she is dying?

The easy move would have been to hide from those questions again. Pick up the controller. Pick up my phone. Find some new distraction to drown everything out.

I had done that for years. This time the guilt was too loud.

It felt like every bad decision I had made lined up in front of me and stared back. Every swipe. Every night wasted. Every time I told myself I would get serious later.

At some point the questions changed from “why did this happen” to “what am I going to do about it.”

That switch matters.

Pain without responsibility just turns into bitterness. Pain with responsibility turns into fuel.

### The deal I made with myself

Sitting there, back against the wall, I made a quiet deal.

I cannot change where I started.  
I cannot change what I have already wasted.  
I cannot bring my daughter back.

But I can refuse to let the rest of my life look like the first part.

I can refuse to be the guy who saw how the Matrix works and still chose to stay plugged in.

That decision did not feel heroic. It felt like survival. Like if I did not change, I would die the same kind of slow death as everyone else in that system. Just with more pain on my record.

Once that settled in, the question turned into something simpler.

What is the next thing I can do that is not bullshit?

### First moves

The first real move I made was not glamorous. I went to thrift stores.

I started scanning used books with a cheap scanner and my phone, checking which ones I could send to Amazon and resell for more than I paid after fees.

I drove around on my off days, dug through shelves, scanned, bought, brought piles home, packed boxes, labeled them, and shipped them in.

It was not some mastermind business. It was me admitting I needed to learn how buying and selling really worked, not just how to punch a clock.

From there I moved into online arbitrage.  
Looking for underpriced books on the internet instead of only in thrift stores.  
Building crude spreadsheets.  
Learning how shipping, storage, fees, and sales rank really work.  
Learning that “revenue” and “profit” are not the same thing.

At the same time I started soaking up everything I could about money and systems.

Books.  
E‑books.  
PDFs people sold for cheap.  
Articles.  
Videos that actually talked about numbers instead of hype.

I used AI like a late‑night study partner. I would ask it to break down business models, tax concepts, the way credit really works, anything I could not wrap my head around fast enough on my own. I did not treat it like magic. I treated it like a way to catch up on a decade of missed education.

Those months did not make me rich.

They did something more important.

They broke the spell that said “you are just a worker.”

### What changed and what didn’t

From the outside, not a lot changed at first.

I still worked my job.  
I still paid bills.  
I still had debt.  
I still had nights where the grief knocked me flat.

But the time after work stopped belonging completely to distraction.

I started treating those hours like a second shift.

The first shift kept us alive.  
The second shift was for learning and building.

Sometimes I only had an hour in me. Sometimes more. Some nights I failed and slid back into old habits. But the direction of my life started tilting.

Instead of ending every day thinking “I wasted another one,” I began ending some days thinking “at least today I pushed the ball forward a little.”

The trap was still there. I was still in it. But I was no longer pretending it was not a trap.

I was studying the walls.

### Why this matters for you

You might not have my exact story. You might not have lost a child. I hope you never do.

But if you are already behind, you probably know what it feels like to look at your bank account, your job, your credit cards, and your habits and feel that mix of shame, anger, and tiredness.

The point of this chapter is not to say “go start a book business.” That was just my way of putting my hands on something real.

The point is this:

You need a room in your life where you stop lying to yourself.

For me, it was a bathroom floor. For you it might be a car, a walk at night, a corner of your room. Somewhere you can ask ugly questions and not run from them.

What have I actually built with my time so far?  
What poison have I let into my life and called it comfort or safety?  
If nothing changes, what does my life look like at forty or fifty?

Those questions hurt, but they beat staying numb.

Once you have asked them, you need to do what I did next: pick one move that is not bullshit and start doing it on repeat.

In the next chapter, I will lay out how I started to understand the money game for people like us, and how I split it into stages that made sense when you are not starting with a trust fund or a clean slate.

CHAPTER 4 – How the Money Game Really Works When You’re Already Behind
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Most money advice is written for people who are not in your position.

It is written for people who have parents that can bail them out, or who started with no debt, or who make enough that a “10% savings rule” actually means something. It is written for people who are not waking up every day already behind on time, money, and pain.

When you are starting where I started, you cannot copy their playbook.

You cannot leap straight into “invest in index funds” when you are getting rocked by overdraft fees. You cannot “start a business with runway” when you do not even have a cushion for a flat tire. You cannot “just grind harder” inside the same job matrix and expect a miracle.

From the bathroom floor, I started to see that there are really three levels to the money game for people like us:

1. **Survive**  
2. **Stabilize**  
3. **Asymmetry**

If you try to skip a level, the game throws you back down harder.

### Level 1: Survive

Survive is where most people stay forever.

Survive means:

* You are trading hours for money.  
* You are always close to zero.  
* Any big hit sends you backwards.  
* Money mostly goes toward bills, interest, and numbing yourself.

In survive mode, you are not building anything. You are patching holes.

You might convince yourself you are “working on it” because you are tired all the time. Being tired is not the same thing as moving forward. Survive mode will happily eat your whole life while making you feel like you are doing the right thing.

At this level, the main goal is not to “make your money work for you.” That is a fantasy for later.

The goal of survive is **to stop the bleeding**.

You do that by:

* Stopping new debt from piling on.  
* Cutting obviously stupid spending you know is just coping.  
* Protecting your ability to work and think (sleep, basic health).  
* Getting honest about where your money actually goes.

It is brutal because you do not see big wins yet. You see small fires going out instead of new houses being built. But if you skip this, everything else collapses.

### Level 2: Stabilize

Stabilize is when you finally get a little bit of space between you and disaster.

It does not mean you are comfortable. It does not mean you are rich. It means:

* You have some predictability.  
* You are not adding to the fire every month.  
* You start to have **options** instead of only reactions.

In stabilize, you are still probably in a job. You still might have debt. But you are not sleepwalking in the same way.

You might:

* Have a small emergency buffer starting to grow.  
* Have one or two debts on a clear payoff path.  
* Have evenings that are not completely wasted.  
* Have some skills or systems starting to form.

Stabilize is where you build **competence**.

You learn how to:

* Track money without lying to yourself.  
* Say no to things that keep you broke.  
* Show up for a second shift of work (learning or building) after your job.  
* Think in months and years, not just days.

It is still not sexy. No one claps for stabilize. But it is the first point where your future is not fully owned by crisis.

### Level 3: Asymmetry

Asymmetry is where every “success post” on the internet wants to start the story.

They show you people taking big swings and winning. Crypto bets. Startups. Real estate. Content. Products. It looks like they rolled dice and walked away rich.

What you do not see is everything that came before. Or how different their starting point was from yours.

For someone like you, asymmetry is not YOLO gambling. It is **small, controlled bets where the downside will not destroy you and the upside can move your life.**

Examples of asymmetric moves from the bottom:

* Learning a skill you can sell for more than your job pays per hour.  
* Building a simple service or product once and selling it many times.  
* Using AI and systems to do work faster, better, or cheaper than other people.  
* Taking on a calculated risk that might add a few hundred or thousand a month, not chasing a lottery ticket.

The key is this:

> In asymmetry, you are not risking rent money to feel alive. You are using the space created in stabilize to take shots that can actually change your position.

When you are already behind, you do not get endless shots. You cannot blow up over and over and “learn from failure” like rich kids talk about. You have to protect your base while still refusing to stay stuck.

That is why the three levels matter.

If you are in survive and pretend you are in asymmetry, you gamble and sink deeper.  
If you are in stabilize and never move to asymmetry, you stay stuck grinding forever.  
If you reach asymmetry and forget survive and stabilize rules, you can still crash back down.

### Where I was

On that bathroom floor, I was deep in survive.

Credit cards.  
No savings.  
Job I depended on.  
Pain I did not know how to carry.

The book hustle and online arbitrage did not magically jump me to asymmetry. But they did something important: they cracked open stabilize.

I started to understand profit vs revenue. I started to understand fees, systems, and how a small edge can matter when multiplied. I started to see that there are games where effort can compound instead of reset every pay period.

I was still behind. But for the first time, I could see a path that did not end in the same warehouse, the same truck, the same counter.

In the next chapter, I am going to talk about the poisons that keep you pinned in survive, even when you think you are playing higher levels, and the rules I started using to stop feeding them.

CHAPTER 5 – Killing Poison
--------------------------

There are three main things that keep men like us pinned exactly where the system wants us:

1. Poison money.  
2. Poison time.  
3. Poison stories.

You already know their names.

Poison money is credit and debt you pretend is safety or “normal.”  
Poison time is distraction dressed up as “relaxing” or “I deserve this.”  
Poison stories are the lies you tell yourself so you do not have to change.

You cannot move out of survive if you keep swallowing all three.

### Poison money

I have already told you how credit card lies played out in my life. The important part now is not my story, but what you do with yours.

You do not fix poison money overnight. You fix it by changing how you see it and how you touch it.

Basic rules that I wish someone had put in my face at eighteen:

* A credit card is not income. It is someone else’s money with a noose tied to it.  
* “Building credit” is pointless if you never use that credit to escape the paycheck cage.  
* Minimum payments are not neutral. They are a tax on your future self.  
* Interest does not care about your feelings, intentions, or rough patches.

If you are already behind, the first money move is not clever investing. It is **stopping new poison from going in.**

Simple steps:

* Stop opening new cards just because you qualify.  
* Stop putting non‑emergency, non‑essential stuff on credit.  
* Set up auto‑pay for at least the minimums so you stop stacking fees.  
* If you can, pick one card and start hitting it harder, just to feel something actually going down instead of sideways.

You do not have to become the perfect debt warrior tomorrow. You just have to stop lying that credit is your friend.

### Poison time

Time poison is trickier because nobody sends you a bill for it.

There is no statement at the end of the month that says:

> “You spent 112 hours this month numbing yourself and now you owe ten years of regret.”

You only get that statement when it is too late. When you are twenty‑nine and looking back at thousands of hours that could have built something but did not.

I am not going to tell you to never touch a game, never watch a show, never scroll. That is not real. What I will tell you is this:

If you are already behind, you cannot afford to live like your time is free.

Ask yourself three questions about your evenings:

* How many hours did I actually build something this week?  
* How many hours did I hand over to screens because I did not want to feel what I was feeling?  
* If I keep this ratio for the next five years, where do I end up?

You do not need a spreadsheet to answer that last one. Your gut already knows.

The rule I started using was simple:

> If you work a nine‑to‑five, you owe your future at least some kind of five‑to‑nine.

Not four more hours of slavery. But **some** hours where you are awake and sober and pointed at learning, building, or fixing.

Some nights that will be one hour. Some nights it will be three. Some nights you will fail and slide back. The point is not perfection. The point is that the default is no longer “I get home and disappear.”

### Poison stories

Poison stories are the things you whisper to yourself so you can keep doing what is killing you.

Stuff like:

* “I work hard, I deserve to relax.”  
* “Everyone has debt.”  
* “I will fix this when I make more.”  
* “It is not my fault, I started behind.”  
* “One more year like this and then I will change.”

Some pieces of those stories are true. That is what makes them dangerous.

You **do** work hard. The system **is** rigged. You **did** start behind. You **do** deserve to rest.

But here is the part nobody tells you:

The truth does not care how you feel about it.

Your bank account does not care how hard you worked or how unfair your childhood was. Your debt does not care that you “needed a break.” Your future does not care what you meant to do.

When I caught myself telling these stories, I started asking one question:

> “If I keep believing this sentence for the next ten years, where does it take me?”

If the answer was “exactly where I already am,” I stopped letting myself say it without a fight.

Killing poison stories is not about becoming some cold machine. It is about refusing to be your own jailer.

### Why this chapter matters

You cannot build anything real while you are actively feeding the things that are killing you.

Cutting poison money, poison time, and poison stories does not make your life easy. It often makes it harder at first, because now you feel everything you were dodging.

But it is also the only way forward.

In the next chapter, I will map out what a one to three year path can actually look like when you start from the bathroom floor instead of from a trust fund, and how to think about small, asymmetric moves that can move you out of survive without blowing up what you have left.

CHAPTER 6 – A One to Three Year Plan From the Bottom
----------------------------------------------------

If you picked up this book looking for a magic trick, you should already know by now you are in the wrong place.

There is no clean, pretty path from where I was to “rich.” There is, however, a real path from where I was to **not owned**. To breathing room. To options. To a life that is not fully controlled by a boss, a bill, or a bad day.

This chapter is for the guy who is reading this with a job, some debt, not much savings, and not a lot of trust left in advice.

I am not going to give you a rigid checklist. I am going to give you **frames** and **non‑negotiables** that you can fit around your life.

Think of the next three years as three overlapping jobs:

1. Stop making things worse.  
2. Build a stable base.  
3. Take small, real shots at asymmetry.

### Year 1 – Stop making it worse

Your first year is mostly about **damage control** and **awareness**.

You will not feel like a winner yet. You will probably feel more pain, because you will stop hiding from what is going on.

That is fine. You have to walk through it to get out.

Year 1 priorities:

* **Track reality.** For at least a few months, write down what actually comes in and what goes out. No perfect app needed. Notes on your phone are enough. The point is to destroy the illusion that “it will work itself out.”  
* **Freeze new poison.** No new credit cards. No new payment plans for things you do not absolutely need. Stop using cards for anything you could have planned for.  
* **Cut one big leak.** Maybe it is eating out. Maybe it is subscriptions. Maybe it is random Amazon buys. Pick one category that you know is dumb for where you are and deliberately shrink it.  
* **Build a tiny buffer.** Even a few hundred dollars in a separate account changes how hits feel. You are training yourself to have something besides zero.  
* **Claim a second shift.** Pick certain days or blocks of time where you are not allowed to numb out by default. Those blocks are for learning, building, or fixing only.

You will still have bad days. You will still fall back into old patterns some nights. The measure of success in Year 1 is not perfection. It is that your **average week** looks different than the ones that got you here.

### Year 2 – Build a base

Once you have some control over your money and time, Year 2 is about **getting boring in the right ways**.

You are not trying to impress anyone. You are trying to build a floor that does not collapse every time life jumps on it.

Year 2 priorities:

* **Strengthen income.** If you can get a better‑paying job without wrecking your life, do it. If you cannot, focus on being the kind of person who can show up enough to keep the checks coming while you work on other things.  
* **Clean up one major debt.** Pick the worst or the easiest to kill and make it your project. Every dollar that stops going to interest becomes fuel later.  
* **Define your asymmetric lane.** Figure out what kind of bets make sense for you. Is it selling a skill? A service? Physical products? Digital products? Something else? You do not need the perfect answer. You just need a lane that is not pure fantasy.  
* **Grow competence.** Take your second shift seriously. Get better at something that is not your job. This is where skills, systems, and tools like AI become weapons instead of toys.

By the end of Year 2, you should not be rich, but you should be much less fragile. One car repair should be annoying, not catastrophic. One bad month should sting, not ruin you.

Most people never get here because they refuse to be bored on purpose.

### Year 3 – Small, real asymmetry

If you have done the work in Years 1 and 2, Year 3 is where you start to feel the game tilt.

This is when you start making moves that are not just “stay alive” but **“change the slope of my life.”**

Year 3 priorities:

* **Launch or lean into one asymmetric play.** Not ten. One. Maybe it is your own small product. Maybe it is a service. Maybe it is a system that uses AI to do something better or faster than others. The key is that it has real upside and will not destroy you if it flops.  
* **Tie your time to output, not just hours.** Look for ways your extra effort now can keep paying you later. That might mean content, code, templates, a client book, whatever fits your lane.  
* **Reinvest wins.** When something works and money comes in, do not let it vanish into lifestyle. Use at least some of it to strengthen your base or fuel the next move.  
* **Guard against backsliding.** The moment you start to feel a little ahead, the Matrix will whisper, “You earned a break.” Be careful which breaks you take. Some are rest. Some are relapse.

By the end of Year 3, if you have been honest and consistent, your life should have a different shape:

* Less debt, more buffer.  
* Fewer nights lost to numbing.  
* At least one skill or system that can make you money outside your job.  
* A mind that sees through the old lies.

Will you be rich? Probably not yet. But you will not be the same person the system trained you to be. You will not be as easy to own.

### Non‑negotiable rules

Whatever exact path you take, there are a few rules I would hand to any man in this position.

1. **If you work for someone else from nine to five, you owe your future some version of five to nine.**  
   That does not always mean four hours every night. It means you cannot give every decent waking hour to a job and expect your life to magically change.

2. **If you are still using credit cards for non‑essentials, you are not serious about freedom.**  
   Emergencies happen. Life happens. But if you are swiping for wants and calling it “self‑care” while saying you want out, your actions and words do not match.

3. **If a story you tell yourself leads to the same life in ten years, stop feeding it.**  
   “I’ll fix it when I make more.” “Everyone lives like this.” “I started too far behind.” These might feel true, but if believing them keeps you in the same place, they are poison.

If you ignore everything else in this book, hold onto these.

They are simple, but they cut through most excuses.

### What this book cannot do for you

I am not going to lie and say that reading and “understanding” this is enough.

You already know that is not how anything real works.

This book cannot:

* Make you disciplined without your effort.  
* Rewrite the past.  
* Guarantee success in any specific hustle or investment.  
* Change the fact that the system is rigged.

What it can do is give you a **clearer map** than the one you were handed. It can help you stop making the same silent agreements that have been draining you. It can show you that you are not crazy for feeling trapped, and also not hopeless for wanting out.

The rest is on you.

CONCLUSION – What You Owe Yourself Now
--------------------------------------

You and I did not start on the same square as a lot of people who write money books.

We did not have parents drawing charts at the dinner table. We had parents missing, broken, or barely holding on. We did not have investment accounts opened in our names. We had bills, overdrafts, and confusing mail. We did not get “how to build” talks. We got “don’t screw this up” looks.

You could spend the rest of your life being angry about that.

There are days I still am.

But here is the part that matters now:

You know better.

You have seen the Matrix from the inside. You have felt what it is like to be owned by a job, by cards, by your own habits. You have tasted that sick feeling of looking back at years you cannot get back.

You have also, if you made it this far in this book, proven something else: you are not completely numb. You still care enough to look.

You owe it to yourself, to anyone who depends on you, and to anyone you have lost, to not let that awareness die.

No one is coming to fix this for you. That is the bad news and the good news.

Bad, because it would be nice if someone showed up with a check and a plan.  
Good, because once you accept that, you stop waiting and start building.

Your job after this is not to turn into a robot who never feels tired or sad or tempted. Your job is to stop pretending you have infinite time.

If you are already behind, every year you drift is a year you will pay for later with interest.

The world does not need more men who are half awake, half angry, and half resigned. It needs men who have seen exactly how ugly the game can be and still decide to play it better.

You started in a trailer park. You worked in heat and dust. You got sold credit as safety. You buried a child. You learned the hard way what numbness costs.

Now you have a choice.

You can go back to sleep.  
Or you can take what you have seen, what you have felt, and use it as fuel to build something that looks nothing like where you came from.

You are already behind. That is true.  
You are also still here. That matters more.

Get up from whatever floor you are sitting on.  
Look at your numbers.  
Kill some poison.  
Claim a second shift.  
Take one small, real shot.

Then do it again tomorrow.

That is how men like us break out.
