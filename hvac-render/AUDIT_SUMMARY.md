## 💰 ROI Pitch for HVAC Owners

### The Math

**Scenario: HVAC owner spends $2,000/month on Google Ads**

**Current site** (typical HVAC website with menus, blog, galleries):
- 500 visitors/month
- 2% conversion rate (industry average)
- 10 leads/month
- 3 booked jobs
- **Cost per job: $667**

**This landing page** (conversion-optimized, zero friction):
- 500 visitors/month (same traffic)
- 7% conversion rate (conservative estimate)
- 35 leads/month
- 10 booked jobs (3x more)
- **Cost per job: $200**

**Result: Save $467 per job OR book 7 more jobs with same budget**

If average job value is $800, that's **$5,600 more revenue per month** = **$67,200/year**

### The One-Liner

> "Your current site is a brochure. This is a cash register."
