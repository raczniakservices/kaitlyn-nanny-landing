HVAC DEMO LANDING PAGE
MASTER BUILD CHECKLIST (CURSOR SPEC)
GOAL

Create a single, ultra-high-converting HVAC landing page designed only to turn Google traffic into booked jobs.
No branding for a specific company. This is a demo page to show HVAC owners what they are missing.

Primary KPI: Form submissions + phone calls

1. STRUCTURE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Single page only

No navbar menus

No blog

No careers

No galleries

No outbound links

One primary action at all times

If something does not increase conversions, it does not exist.

2. ABOVE-THE-FOLD SECTION (MOST IMPORTANT)
Headline (large, bold, human)

Must clearly state urgency + local service.

Example direction (not exact copy):
“Need HVAC Service This Weekend? Get Scheduled in Under 60 Seconds.”

Rules:

Must mention speed or immediacy

Must imply weekend or emergency availability

Must be readable on mobile without scrolling

Subheadline

Reassurance + location.

Example direction:
“Local, licensed HVAC service for urgent repairs, maintenance, and emergency calls in your area.”

Primary CTA (button)

Text must be action-based, not generic

Example: “Request Service Now” or “Get Scheduled Today”

Button scrolls directly to form

Button color contrasts heavily with background

Secondary CTA (optional)

Click-to-call button

Sticky on mobile

Visible phone icon

3. MOBILE FIRST REQUIREMENTS

Entire page designed for mobile first, desktop second

Sticky bottom bar on mobile with:

Call button

Request Service button

No text blocks longer than 3 lines on mobile

Form usable with one thumb

Cursor must test mobile responsiveness explicitly.

4. TRUST SIGNALS (ABOVE FORM)

Include these before the user is asked to submit:

“Licensed & Insured”

“Serving [City] & Surrounding Areas”

“Emergency & Weekend Calls Available”

“Fast response times”

Optional:

Star icons with “5-Star Rated Local HVAC Service”

No fake reviews. Keep generic.

5. THE FORM (CRITICAL)
Form placement

First full form appears no more than 1 scroll down

Duplicate form again at bottom of page

Required fields ONLY

No friction. No extras.

Fields:

First name

Phone number (required)

City or ZIP

Issue type (dropdown)

No heat

No AC

System making noise

Maintenance

Emergency

Preferred timeframe

ASAP

Today

This weekend

Flexible

Submit button copy

Must imply speed and response.

Examples:

“Get Scheduled”

“Request Service”

“Have a Tech Contact Me”

After submit behavior

Display confirmation message:
“Thanks. A technician will contact you shortly.”

This is a demo. Do not promise exact timing.

6. COPY RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

No em dashes

No corporate language

No marketing buzzwords

Read like a real human wrote it

Short sentences

Plain English

If it sounds like AI, rewrite it.

7. VISUAL STYLE

Clean

Neutral HVAC colors (blue, dark gray, white)

One hero background image related to HVAC work

No stock photos of smiling models

Use real-looking HVAC imagery

8. PERFORMANCE

Page must load fast

Minimal JavaScript

No bloated libraries

Optimized images

Lighthouse performance score should be high

9. HOSTING REQUIREMENTS

Deploy on Render

Public URL

HTTPS enabled

Simple domain or subdomain is fine

Page must be stable and always accessible

10. FINAL PURPOSE CHECK

Before finalizing, Cursor must answer YES to all:

Does this page remove friction compared to most HVAC websites?

Would Google Ads traffic convert better here than a normal site?

Does this page clearly outperform pages with menus, blogs, and calendars?

Would an HVAC owner instantly understand the value?

If any answer is no, iterate.

HOW YOU USE THIS PAGE (STRATEGY CONFIRMATION)

Yes, you are thinking correctly.

You will use this page as:

A visual proof asset in cold emails

A link inside HVAC Facebook groups

A comparison against their current site

A credibility shortcut

You are not selling a landing page.
You are selling more booked jobs with less friction.

IMPORTANT MINDSET SHIFT (READ THIS)

HVAC owners do not care about:

Design awards

Tech stacks

Fancy animations

They care about:

Phone ringing

Jobs booked

Wasted traffic

This page exists to make that obvious in 5 seconds.
