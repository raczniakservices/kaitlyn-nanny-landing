## Marketing assets (Facebook)

This folder contains **editable SVG** graphics you can use for Facebook.

### Files
- `facebook-cover.svg` (recommended FB cover size: 820×312)
- `facebook-post-square.svg` (recommended square post: 1080×1080)
- `profile-avatar.svg` (recommended profile image, exports clean at 512×512)

### How to export to PNG (fast)
1. Open the `.svg` file in Chrome/Edge (drag-and-drop into the browser).
2. Use a screenshot tool, or copy into a design tool (Canva/Figma) and export as PNG.

### If SVGs "don’t open" on Windows
That’s usually because Windows is trying to open them in Photos (which often won’t render SVG). Use one of these:
- Right click the `.svg` → **Open with** → **Microsoft Edge** / **Google Chrome**
- Or upload the `.svg` into Canva/Figma and export PNG

### Pre-exported PNGs (ready to upload)
PNG versions are generated into `marketing-assets/exports/`:
- `marketing-assets/exports/profile-avatar.png`
- `marketing-assets/exports/facebook-cover.png`
- `marketing-assets/exports/facebook-post-square.png`

### Recommended exports
- **Profile photo**: export `profile-avatar.svg` to **512×512 PNG**
- **Cover photo**: export `facebook-cover.svg` to **1640×624 PNG** (Facebook displays it at 820×312)

### Quick edits
Open the `.svg` in any editor (VS Code works) and change:
- Business name / tagline
- Phone/email
- Colors
